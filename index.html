            <p> </p>
            <p>Light or Blue eyes as idealized eye color has roots in eurocentric beauty standards. </p>
            <p>This is a western beauty norm that has spread around the world, celebrating caucas-</p>
            <p>-ian features over others. Of course this has its roots in the racist beauty industry</p> 
            <p>that stems from colonial racism. “In those days, the white plantation owner's daughter</p>
            <p>was the standard of beauty.” Today this still affects us as the beauty industry pushes </p>
            <p> colored contacts on women in order to make money off their insecurities. They claim  </p>
            <p>that blue eyes are regarded as more intelligent, bright, and have studies listed on </p>
            <p>their website claiming that “brown eyes are both the most common and perceived to be </p>
            <p>less attractive, 26.2% of brown-eyed people wished for a different color, while 17.1% </p>
            <p>of hazel-eyed respondents wished the same. 47.6% of respondents would choose to have </p>
            <p>blue eyes if they had a choice in the matter.” Another study claims that blue-eyed  </p>
            <p>women were more likely to get a raise in the past year. This really makes you realize </p>
            <p>that even something as regular as eye color can affect how you are perceived and treated.</p>

        <p>BLONDE HAIR</p>
        <p>"The fact that blonde hair is some sort of signifier of desirability, despite the fact that </p>
        <p>there isn’t really anything inherent that separates it from other hair colors, is </p>
        <p>frankly a little weird. Getting into the origin of this idea seemingly ingrained in</p>
        <p>westernized beauty ideals, it honestly seems even weirder. It all goes back to </p>
        <p>ancient Greece, where blonde hair was considered very exotic. Aphrodite was </p>
        <p>depicted as a blonde, and Sappho praised blonde hair in her poetry. Many </p>
        <p>depictions of great Greek heroes show them as being blond, and prostitutes would </p>       
        <p>dye their hair blond using pigments such as saffron or plant ash. This influence </p>
        <p>extended into Rome, and therefore into the territory it conquered. Even after the </p>
        <p>fall of the empire itself, the Roman influence was very strong in Europe, and so hair</p>
        <p>dyeing became the next hot trend during the medieval period. Fashionable ladies </p>
        <p>would bleach their hair with dyeing agents at the time, such as sulfuric acid or even </p>
        <p>horse urine (how very glamorous), and then spread it out over a specialized kind of </p>
        <p>hat so it could be exposed to the sun. Scandinavians definitely had blonde-centric </p>
        <p>beauty standards, considering it was much more genetically prevalent in the more </p>
        <p>northerly areas. Western Europe had definitely declared that gentlemen, in fact, did prefer blondes."</p>

        <p>THINNESS</p>
        <p>“Thinness offers people privileges nobody speaks of because then we’d have to </p>
        <p>admit we’ve all bought into it. That somehow we’ve all accepted that perfection </p>
        <p>exists in a thin frame, in a skinny body. We connote thinness with a certain brand</p>       
        <p>of easy, carefree beauty, one that is reliably attainable without force or coercion. </p>
        <p>It was the perfect example of how we’ve constantly been taught, through pop</p>
        <p>culture, that women simply are thin, without cultivation. That chicness is inherent, </p>     
        <p>not calculated, or primed to perfection. Femme bodies are anthologized, </p>
        <p>fetishized, and glorified, but they are never embraced with a totality of their </p>
        <p>existence. Or the realities of their quirks, or clumsiness.” “Various studies have </p>
        <p>shown that overweight people are seen as less conscientious, less agreeable, </p>
        <p>less emotionally stable, less productive, lazy, lacking in self-discipline, and </p>
        <p>even dishonest, sloppy, ugly, socially unattractive, and sexually unskilled; the </p>
        <p>list goes on and on.* The stereotypes run so deep that even obese people hold </p>
        <p>these same discriminatory beliefs about other obese people. Therefore, it may </p>
        <p>come as no surprise that research has provided strong evidence that obese </p>
        <p>people are paid less than their slimmer counterparts. Skinny women got paid </p>
        <p>substantially higher salaries than heavier women, yet this relationship was </p>
        <p>much less pronounced at the higher ends of the scale. Meaning that a female </p>
        <p>employee weighing 50 kilograms would get paid substantially more than </p>
        <p>someone weighing 60 kilograms, but the difference between 70 and 80 was </p>
        <p>much less severe. That’s probably because – as Dan and Tim put it – “the </p>
        <p>social preferences for a feminine body have already been violated”; you’re </p>
        <p>either skinny or not, but once you’re over the (rather extreme) threshold, we </p>
        <p>don’t care much anymore about the number on your scale.        </p>
        <p>Yet, this relationship looked very different for men. In contrast to the women </p>
        <p>in the sample, men of moderate weight would get paid substantially more than </p>
        <p>skinny men. But such a man of average weight would also get paid quite a bit </p>
        <p>more than an obese person. Hence, being skinny for a woman would mean </p>
        <p>more dosh, but for men it would mean less money – all in the order of </p>
        <p>magnitude of $10,000-15,000 per year."        </p>

    <p>SKIN TONE</p>
    <p>"Across the board, women of color are more likely than white women to be </p>
    <p>shunted into the lowest-earning occupations in the service sector and in </p>
    <p>sales and office jobs. This trend is particularly pronounced for Hispanic </p>
    <p>women. Among working women in 2014, 62 percent of Hispanics were </p>
    <p>clustered into just two job groups—service occupations and sales and office </p>
    <p>occupations. This is compared with 57 percent of blacks, 51 percent of </p>
    <p>whites, and 44 percent of Asians in the same job categories.    </p>
    <p>In 2014, only 35 percent of black women and 26 percent of Hispanic women </p>
